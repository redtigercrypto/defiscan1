# Summary

Compound-v3 is a lending protocol that accepts a base asset as liquidity and allows borrowing this bas asset with a variety of other assets as collateral. Multiple base assets are supported such as USDC.e, USDC, WETH, and USDT. Each base asset represents an isolated lending market managed by a separate instance of the protocol. Compound governance is able to update various parameters for each of these markets.

# Overview

## Chain

Compound III is deployed on various chains. This review is based on the Arbitrum chain, an Ethereum L2 in Stage 1 according to L2BEAT.

> Chain score: Medium

## Upgradeability

The Compound-v3 protocol is fully upgradeable allowing for the update of governance and markets logic and state (specifically the `Governance` and `Comet` implementation contracts). This can result in the loss of funds or unclaimed yield as well as lead to other changes in the expected performance of the protocol.

The permission to upgrade the protocol is controlled by an onchain governance system with `COMP` token holders submitting and voting on respective proposals. A multisig account, the `ProposalGuardian`, has the permission to cancel proposals to mitigate the risk of malicious or otherwise unintended proposals. This role can potentially be abused to censor proposals.

Furthermore, another multisig account, the `PauseGuardian`, has the permission to pause markets, disabling depositing and withdrawing assets, if suspicious activity is detected. This role can potentially be abused to freeze funds and unclaimed yield in the protocol.

Upgrades happen through governance proposal on Ethereum Mainnet. A `Bridge Receiver` receives messages from the mainnet governance and sends them to a local `TimeLock` that ensures the transactions are only executed during the correct execution period, after a delay.

> Upgradeability score: High

## Autonomy

The compound-v3 protocol relies on a Chainlink oracle feed to price collateral and base assets in the system. The protocol does not validate asset prices returned by Chainlink or offer a fallback oracle mechanism. The replacement of a stale or untrusted oracle feed requires a Compound governance vote with a delay (see [Exit Window](#exit-window)).

The Chainlink oracle system itself is upgradeable without decentralized ownership over those permissions. This dependency thus introduces centralization risk in the Compound-v3 protocol.

> Autonomy score: High

## Exit Window

Permissions, including protocol upgrades, are controlled by an onchain governance system on Ethereum mainnet. `COMP` holders are able to create new proposals (requires 25,000 `COMP`) and vote on proposals (at least 400,000 votes are required for a valid proposal). A minimum voting period of 3 days is enforced as well as a delay of 3 days for the implementation of successful proposals.

While this does not meet the 7-day exit window requirement, malicious or unintended proposals can be intercepted by the `ProposalGuardian` multisig account.

However, the `ProposalGuardian` multisig accounts does not meet the Security Council requirements ([see below](#security-council)).

> Exit Window score: High

## Accessibility

The frontend of Compound V3 is open source. Instructions to deploy it locally or deploy it
on IPFS are available [here](https://github.com/compound-finance/palisade). However, the frontend depends on a separate backend that is accessed through [v3-api.compound.finance/](https://v3-api.compound.finance/). Therefore, self-hosting does not help if the backend is down.
Nonetheless, compound is supported on third-party apps like DeFiSaver. These apps build an acceptable backup solution in case of failure of the official frontend and backend.

> Accessibility score: Medium

## Conclusion

The Compound-v3 Ethereum mainnet protocol achieves Low decentralization scores for its _Upgradeability_, _Autonomy_ and _Exit Window_ dimensions. It thus ranks Stage 0.

The protocol could reach Stage 1 by 1) adopting a _Security Council_ setup for the `ProposalGuardian` multisig accounts, and 2) implementing validity checks and a fallback mechanism around the Chainlink oracle (or Chainlink adopting a _Security Council_ setup for its own multisig account).

> Overall score: Stage 0

# Technical Analysis

Below is an overview of the contracts from the Compound V3 protocol.

![Overview of the compound protocol](./compound-v3-arbitrum-overview.png)

⚠️ During our analysis, we noticed many of the contract addresses listed in the [official documentation](https://docs.compound.finance/) are out of date. This is most likely explained by the high frequency of updates to the implementation contracts. The list below was last updated on the 20th of February 2025.

| Configurator (Implementation) | updateAssetPriceFeed                  | Updates the price feed contract address for a specific asset. An abusive update could point to a malicious price feed and put user's funds at risk through wrongful liquidations or price manipulation attacks.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | Arbitrum TimeLock (Mainnet DAO)                 |
| Configurator (Implementation) | updateAssetBorrowCollateralFactor     | Updates the borrow collateral factor for an asset in the protocol: the fraction of an asset’s value that can be borrowed against. If set too high this can increase the likelihood of defaults. This value is checked for bounds at the time of deployment.                                                                                                                                                                                               | Arbitrum TimeLock (Mainnet DAO)                 |

A malicious admin could hijack the whole protocol.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | Arbitrum TimeLock (Mainnet DAO)                 |
| CometProxyAdmin               | upgrade                               | Triggers the update of either a `Comet (Implementation)` contract or `Configurator (Implementation)` contract. A malicious proposal not stopped by the `ProposerGuardian` could use this function to replace a `Comet (Implementation)` contract and steal funds.                                                                                                                                                                                         | Arbitrum TimeLock (Mainnet DAO)                 |
| CometProxyAdmin               | upgradeAndCall                        | Triggers the update of either a `Comet (Implementation)` contract or `Configurator (Implementation)` contract and calls a function in the new contract. A malicious proposal not stopped by the `ProposerGuardian` could use this function to replace a `Comet (Implementation)` contract and steal funds.                                                                                                                                                | Arbitrum TimeLock (Mainnet DAO)                 |
| CometProxyAdmin               | renounceOwnership                     | Abandons ownership of the contract. The DAO would renounce the access to the administrative functions of the contracts, which includes upgrading the `Comet Implementation` and `Configurator Implementation` contracts. Without other prior adaptations this could present a vulnerability as it would freeze the parameters of the `Comet (Implementation)`contracts.                                                                                   | Arbitrum TimeLock (Mainnet DAO)                 |

The permissions for all Comet contracts (USDC, WETH, wsETH, USDT, USDS) are similar and therefore only
represented once as `Comet Proxy` and `Comet Implementation`in the table above.

## Dependencies

The compound-v3 protocol relies on a Chainlink oracle feed to price collateral and base assets in the system. The protocol does not validate asset prices returned by Chainlink feeds other than checking for a zero-value. The protocol further does not offer a fallback pricing mechanism in case the Chainlink oracle feeds are stale or untrusted. If not performing as expected, Chainlink oracle feeds can only be replaced through a regular Compound governance proposal with a delay (see Exit Window).

The Chainlink oracle system itself is upgradeable potentially resulting in the publishing of unintended or malicious prices. The permissions to upgrade are controlled by a [multisig account](https://etherscan.io/address/0x21f73D42Eb58Ba49dDB685dc29D3bF5c0f0373CA) with a 4-of-9 signers threshold. This multisig account is listed in the Chainlink docs but signers are not publicly announced. The Chainlink multisig thus does not suffice the Security Council requirements specified by either L2Beat or DeFiScan resulting in a High centralization score.

## Upgrade process

Any market parameter change requires a new `Comet` deployment. The process is as follows:

1.  new parameters are set using setters in the `Configurator` contract.
2.  the `ProxyAdmin` contract uses `deployAndUpgradeTo`:
    1. Deploys a new comet contract through the `Configurator`, which uses the `CometFactory`.
    2. Updates the corresponding `Comet Proxy` to point to this newly deployed contract.

A malicious update could simply perform the update to the `Comet Proxy`to introduce a malicious `Comet Implementation` contract, effectively stealing funds.
This is because the `upgrade` function can still be called by the DAO in addition to `deployAndUpgradeTo`, allowing the DAO to deploy `Comet` contracts not created by the `Configurator`.

The process is illustrated below.

# Security Council

A security council called `Pause Guardian` has the power to pause all deposits, withdrawals, and transfers
in the Arbitrum `Comet` contracts. The guardian is currently a 4/7 multisig made of Compound DAO community members and other trusted entities. The signers are announced [here](https://www.comp.xyz/t/community-multisig-4-of-6-deployment/134/18).
A `Proposal Guardian` on Ethereum Mainnet has the power to cancel Governance Proposals before their executions. It is composed of a 4/8 multisig made of the same entities announced for the `Pause Guardian`, with one additional signer that prevents the `Proposal Guardian` to qualify as a security council according to our requirements.
